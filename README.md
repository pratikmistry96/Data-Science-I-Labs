# Weill Cornell Medicine - Data Science I - Labs
## Author: Pratik Mistry
## Semester: Fall 2020

As a part of my Masters in Biostatistics and Data Science at Weill Cornell Medicine, we were assigned a series of labs to complete in R or Python.

The folders in this repository contain all my completed labs with their instructions and corresponding R markdown files and knitted HTML documents.
